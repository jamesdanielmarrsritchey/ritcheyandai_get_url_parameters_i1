jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Write a javascript function for getting parameters from a URL, and creating global variables with those values.

GitHub Copilot: Here's a JavaScript function that gets parameters from a URL and assigns them to global variables. This function uses the `window.location.search` property to get the query string from the URL, and the `URLSearchParams` API to parse this query string.

```javascript
function getParamsFromUrl() {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
    for (const [key, value] of params.entries()) {
        window[key] = value;
    }
}
```

This function will create global variables with the names of the parameters and assign them the corresponding values. Please note that overusing global variables can lead to code that is hard to debug and maintain. It's generally better to use them sparingly.

jamesdanielmarrsritchey: Add a comment on how to use this function.

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's the function with added comments on how to use it:

```javascript
/**
 * This function gets parameters from the current URL and assigns them to global variables.
 * Each parameter name becomes a global variable name, and its value becomes the variable's value.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 1. Call this function without any arguments.
 * 2. After calling the function, you can access the URL parameters as global variables.
 * 
 * Example:
 * If your URL is "http://example.com?param1=value1&param2=value2", after calling this function,
 * you can access "value1" with the variable param1, and "value2" with the variable param2.
 */
function getParamsFromUrl() {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
    for (const [key, value] of params.entries()) {
        window[key] = value;
    }
}
```

Remember to call this function at a suitable place in your code, such as at the start of your script or inside a `window.onload` event handler.
